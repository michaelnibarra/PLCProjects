<h2>Description</h2>
In my PLC projects, I have utilized CODESYS, an industry-standard software, to design, program, and simulate control systems. My work reflects a strong grasp of both the software and hardware aspects of industrial automation. I am proficient in programming PLCs using various methods, including ladder logic, function block diagrams, structured text, and sequential function charts. My experience extends to configuring digital and analog I/O, integrating sensors, and controlling actuators, all while ensuring efficient and reliable system operation. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of how industrial equipment interfaces with PLCs, enabling me to troubleshoot, optimize, and simulate systems in a virtual environment before deployment to physical hardware. Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in implementing PLC programs for real-world applications, including adhering to safety protocols and coordinating complex machine operations.
